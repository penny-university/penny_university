Hey! Welcome to Penny University.

We are a community of Social Learners.
Historically our community has been supported by an assortment of freely available technologies such as Slack, Google Forum, and Zoom. But as our community matures, a small team of developers is building a platform that we hope will better facilitate our unique culture.

In this short video I will demonstrate a couple of our recent developments. By the end of this video you will know how to better engage with the community by scheduling Penny Chats, inviting others, and engaging with others even after chats are complete.

...
[switch screen to slack]

Let's get started!

Let's say you wanted to organize a discussion about startup funding. You've discussed this with others, gathered interest, and decided on a time.

Creating the Penny Chat invitation is easy. From anywhere in slack, type `/penny chat`

When the modal pops up, enter the title and the description â€“ make sure to add zoom link to your description so that people will know where to meet!
```
Startup Funding Discussion
	
When you're building a startup, how should fund it? When is best to bootstrap? When should you take seed investment? When should you pursue Venture Capital investment? And how?!

In this 45 minute discussion we will talk with Andrew Montalenti, CTO and founder of http://parsely.com/ and possibly Michael Holroyd founder for https://scenethink.com/ about their experiences funding their ventures.
Meet here: https://parsely.zoom.us/j/99153754951
```

Then you select the date and time.

Finally you can share the invite with any one you choose, individuals or entire channels. [select @nick and @michael and # startups]

When you're ready, click "Share Invite", and the invitation will be sent to all those you've invited.
[show invite in # book club](https://penny-university.slack.com/archives/C013ATE3YH5/p1594996148158700) People will see that they have been invited to the chat and will be able to RSVP to let you know that they are coming.

[show # slackbot invite](https://penny-university.slack.com/archives/D42KCQY02/p1594996145000400) You will also see a copy of the invite in # slackbot.
If you made a mistake, no worries, just click "Edit Details" and once you edit and share the chat, the updated invitation will be sent to all invitees.

...
Now why should you use the `/penny chat` command rather than some other method for inviting people to a chat? Lots of reasons!
	* First, as people accept or decline your invitation you will get notified and have a better idea of how many people plan to attend your Penny Chat. [Jim Dandy Click Attend] See, somebody RSVPd just now.
	* [Show screen with PennyChat reminder](https://penny-university.slack.com/archives/D42KCQY02/p1595348545000400) Then, just before the Penny Chat begins, you and everyone that has RSVP'ed will get a reminder that the chat is about to begin. (By the way, that's why it's a great idea to stick your zoom link in the chat description.)	
	* Soon after the chat, you and your attendees will be invited to provide a Penny Chat Follow-up. Certainly, you are under obligation to do a Follow-up, but [CLICK BUTTON] if you had a good conversation, then a follow-up is your opportunity say "thanks" and share a little bit of what you learned with the community.
		* [SCROLL DOWN] In this case several people have already provided a Follow-up.
		* Whenever you want to jump into the conversation, it's easy. Just click "Add new followup", type what you want,  
```
This was a great conversation.

I learned:
* Idea 1: ....
* Idea 2: ....
* Idea 3: ....

Thanks Andrew and Michael for taking time to speak with us. 
```
		 click save, and you're done!

The best reason for creating official Penny Chats using the `/penny chat` command is that you'll have a record of all the great conversations you've had and people you've met. This is available in your Profile in the drop down at the top right of the screen. [CLICK].
	* As you can see, I've got several upcoming chats.
	* And a long list of my past Penny Chats.
		* Look! Here's the last Lightning Talks we did. That one had a lot of interesting Follow-up.

And one last thing to show. From our homepage, you can click on the Chats button and see a list of ALL the upcoming and historic chats of Penny University. And soon we'll add other features, like search.

That's it for now, but we're constantly working to build new surprises for our community. If you have any new ideas or if you're interested in helping, then stop by the # penny-labs channel and let us know.

Thanks.
