def event_processor_decorator(transform_filter_func):
    """Makes an event processor decorator out of the function that it decorates.

    An event processor is a function that takes an event and does something with it. It can be any callable including
    instance methods and class methods. The only constraint is that it should have a single input representing an event
    and that input must be name "event". There is no constraint on what an event is at all.

    In its most basic form, a transform_filter_func takes an event and returns True if the filter applies to that event.
    Such a transform_filter_func decorated by event_processor_decorator itself _becomes_ a decorator that can modify
    processors and filter their events. Examples:

    ```
    @event_processor_decorator
    def contains_kitten(event):
        return 'kitten' in event.text
    ```

    Now `contains_kittens` is a processor decorator that can be used to filter out all events except those that
    contain "kitten".

    ```
    @contains_kitten
    def event_processor(event):
        assert 'kitten' in event.text, 'this should never fail'
    ```

    `@contains_kitten` could also be applied to methods of a class.

    You can also make parameterized event_processor_decorators like this:

    ```
    @event_processor_decorator
    def contains_string(string, event):
        return string in event.text
    ```

    This can be applied to processors more generically because of the parameterization.

    ```
    @contains_string('kitten')
    def event_processor(event):
        assert 'kitten' in event.text, 'this should never fail'
    ```

    This would have the same effect as `@contains_kitten` above.


    Finally, a transform_filter_func can also act as a transformer that _mutates_ an event to anything else. For example

    ```
    @event_processor_decorator
    def frightens_kittens(event):
        if 'kittens' in event.text:
            event.text = event.text + " ... BOO!"
            return event
    ```

    With this transform_filter_func, the following assertions should hold for any event given to the event processor:

    ```
    @contains_kittens
    def event_processor(event):
        assert 'kitten' in event.text, 'this should never fail'
        assert 'BOO' in event.text, 'this should never fail'
    ```
