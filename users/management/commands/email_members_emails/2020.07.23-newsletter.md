Penny Times â€“ Penny University's Newsletter
==============================
Greetings to Social Learners everywhere,

Check it out, this is our first official Penny University newsletter! Periodically, we will use these newsletters to let you know about recent and upcoming Penny Chats and introduce you to interesting ideas and interesting people that we've met inside of Penny University.

Coming next Tuesday evening, you will have an exciting opportunity to meet other life-long learners like yourselves at the our newest Lightening Talks session - 5 minutes to teach us all something that is of interest to you. On deck: I will be teaching you the 2,500yr old game of Go, Nathan will present a recipe, Ary will talk about his experiences as a day trader, and Nicole, the chat organizer, will talk about cafe culture (which I think has _something_ to do with the original Penny Universities!). These are always fun, so please come! [Details can be found here.](https://www.pennyuniversity.org/chats/177) 

When you're building a startup, how should you fund it? When is best to bootstrap? When should you take seed investment? When should you pursue Venture Capital investment? And how?! This past Tuesday we invited Andrew Montalenti (founder of [Parse.ly](https://www.parse.ly/)) and Michael Holroyd (founder of [SceneThink](https://scenethink.com/)) to set down with us and tell us about their experiences funding their own ventures. [Here is Follow-up](https://www.pennyuniversity.org/chats/176) but you can also check out the [full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDEV-AGy95I&feature=youtu.be&t=101).

More cool stuff is on the horizon, so stay tuned! Questions and comments? Please direct them to me, [John Berryman](jfberryman@gmail.com). I look forward to hearing from you.

Happy learning!
