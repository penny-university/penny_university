From its inception, Penny University has been a community for people that love learning, and sharing with others. And while the purpose remains the same, the community, culture, and platform are constantly evolving. Today, we are excited to reveal the biggest update to the platform to date. We are getting rid of the Google Groups forum, and moving to a custom web application.

{% if active_member %}Want to see it for yourself? Since you have been active in Penny University, what better way to explore the app than to take a look through your own chats! Check them out in your new profile page: {{ profile_url }}{% endif %}

Here's what {% if profile_url %}else {% endif %}you can look forward to:

* Check out the chats page ( https://www.pennyuniversity.org/chats/ ) for a list of interesting chats from the past and upcoming chats that you might want to join.
* Want to schedule your own chat? Then, from our Slack workspace ( https://penny-university.slack.com/ ) just try typing in `/penny chat`. A modal will open where you can fill out the title and description, date, and invitees. Once you submit the chat request, we will invite people on your behalf, notify you as they RSVP, and send a reminder to attendees just before the chat begins.
* Finally, all of your Penny Chats will be recorded for posterity on your own profile page{% if profile_url %}: {{ profile_url }}{% endif %}. Review this page regularly to see if there are any new follow-up comments!

Where do we go from here? Well, anywhere that you wish to take us! This is *your* community, and so long as our mission stays true – as long as we're learning together – we intend to build the platform that facilitates that mission. If you were once part of Penny University, then now might be an interesting time to come back! If you're already active, then this is a fantastic time to invite others. Check us out at https://www.pennyuniversity.org.

Talk to you soon!
