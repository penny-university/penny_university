From it's inception, Penny University has been a community for people that love learning, and sharing with others. And while the purpose remains the same, the community, culture, and platform are constantly evolving. Today, we are excited to reveal the biggest update to the platform to date. We are getting rid of the Google Groups forum, and moving to a custom web application.

{% if chats_url %}Want to see it for yourself? You've been active in Penny University, so what better way to explore the app than to take a look through your own chats! Check them out in your profile: {{ chats_url }}{% endif %}

Here's what {% if chats_url %}else {% endif %}you can look forward to:

* Check out the chats page (https://www.pennyuniversity.org/chats/) for a list of interesting chats from the past OR upcoming chats that you might want to join.
* Want to schedule your own chat? Then, from our slack workspace (https://penny-university.slack.com/) just try typing in `/penny chat`. You'll be able to fill out the title and description, date and invitees. Once you submit the chat request, we'll invite people on your behalf, tell you when they RSVP or decline the invitation, and remind everyone about the chat just before it occurs.
* Finally, all of your Penny Chats will be recorded for posterity on your own profile page. Review this page regularly to see if there are any new follow-ups on your chats.

Where do we go from here? Well, anywhere that you wish to take us! This is *your* community, and so long as our mission stays true, we intend to build the platform that facilitates that mission. If you were once part of Penny University, then now might be an interesting time to come back. If you're already active, then this is a fantastic time to invite the social learners that you know. Check us our at https://www.pennyuniversity.org.

Talk to you soon!
