                    <p>
                        We believe there is a better way for knowledge to be shared and distributed.
                        People should be at the center of the learning process, and engaging with others
                        is the most effective way for people to expand their minds and skillsets.
                        Communities and businesses grow stronger when people build relationships through
                        mentorship and co-learning, and that is exactly what Penny University is made
                        to accomplish.

                    <p><strong>350 years of history.</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The name "Penny University" is a reference to the early coffeehouses in Oxford, England.
                        These coffeehouses held an important association with the European Age of Enlightenment.
                        For the price of a penny, scholars and laypeople alike would be given admittance to the
                        coffeehouse, enjoy an endless supply of coffee, and more importantly enjoy learning through
                        conversations with their peers. Thus these coffeehouses came to be called "Penny Universities".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our new group, Penny University, serves as a modern take on this old tradition by connecting
                        those who desire to learn with those who are willing to share what they know.
                        This can certainly be at a coffeehouse, but anywhere else as well, including
                        just a quick Google Hangout. There are no mentors or mentees, leaders or followers.

                        Penny Chats with one another to in order to share knowledge, and then write up what
                        they've learned and share it with the community.
